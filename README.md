"The Internet of Things has a dirty little secret: it's not really yours" by Internet of Shit

- The Internet of Shit's article on The Verge criticizes house gadgets that heavily rely on WiFi. The author emphasizes their need for Internet as a major downside in comparison to old "analog" products. Similarly, the author points out that the Internet's fast paced trend cycle is not compatible with physical house gadgets, that need to (or should) last for longer. Finally, the author criticizes the amount of control that manufacturers have over buyers, as their houses now rely on the company's software and support. Simultaneously, these companies are able to collect valuable data, further increasing their support.
- "What we really need from those building the Internet of Things is commitment" &rarr; companies must commit to not abuse the power of having their softawre in consumer's homes
- I think there is a blurry lines in IoTs. Do phones count? If so, there does not seem to be an "unplugged" alternative, as there are with thermostats and lightbulbs. With this in mind, it seems almost impossible to fully avoid IoT.
- Can the Internet of Things be sustainable (for consumers) in the long term? Are the benefits of IOT over "regular" gadgets worth it?

"The Internet of Things: Roadmap to a Connected World" by Sanjay Sarma

- Sarma's article provides, in some sense, a response to Internet of Shit's concerns. Although there is no comment from the manufacturers, Sarma provides clear steps that he believes are viable alternatives for long term success and sustainability of IoT. Most notably, Sarma is concerned with potential security threats of having consumer's houses entirely connected to the internet, each product with its own (potentially incompatible) security protocols.
- "No question about it: The IoT will influence everything from robots and retail to buildings and banking" &rarr; In response to my question above, Sarma seems to believe there isn't (or won't be) aspects of life not affected by IoT. 
- Although Sarma's roadmap is reasonable in the sense that it provides a solid alternative to most security concerns with IoT, I think it is impractical, as it requires manufacturers to collaborate with each other even though they are mostly each other's competition.
- Is Sarma's roadmap viable?

1. Your First Circuit
  ![Circuit One](wk2-img/circuit-one.jpg) ![Measuring Voltage](wk2-img/measuring-volt.jpg)

       1.  Breadboards are very useful!
  
       2.  LEDs work (can be plugged) in both directions
  
       3.  LEDs have specific ammount of V they can handle. The resistance needed can be calculated by using Ohm's Law
  
       4.  Ohm's Law → V = I * R, can be re-arranged to solve for different variables
  
       5.  Our LED worked without resistors due to smaller batteries (three AAA batteries as opposed to a 9V)
   
    + I learned that connecting multiple batteries to a breadboard does not increase the voltage, but that instead they should be connected in parallel. 
  
    + How is voltage affected by chaining batteries together?

2. Let’s Abuse a Battery!
   
   ![Burnt LED](wk2-img/burn-led.jpg)

       1.  Instead of shorting a battery, we burnt an LED by increasing the voltage beyond its limit.
  
       2.  We increased the limit by chaining batteries together in parallel as opposed to in series.
   
    + I learned that connecting multiple batteries to a breadboard does not increase the voltage, but that instead they should be connected in parallel. 

    + How is voltage affected by chaining batteries together?

Critical Engineering Manifesto + Julian Oliver's Artist Profile
- The Critical Engineering Manifesto presents a series of guidelines to guide the discipline. Its creators define engineering as a language and urge critical engineers to use this langugae to examine (and challenge) every aspect of their lives, without disregarding the ethical and social implications of their products (product understood as the result of creation and not a commodity). Oliver's Artist Profile provides two examples of products as engineering starting a conversation (language function) that challenges the established notions of our current life. His projects give a sense of democratizing information and creation, in the sense of taking the power away from large private corporations.
- "Engineering [is] most transformative language of our time, shaping the way we move, communicate and think."
- I think it is interesting that Oliver defines engineering as a language. This has interesting implications, as engineering becomes part of other life processes rather than a discipline on its own. Oliver's definition makes engineering much more prevalent and pervasive. I think this is what makes it interesting.
- How is Julian Oliver blurring the lines between art and engineering through his practices? Is there a real distinction between the two?

## Week 4

### Context

<br>

"The Preserving Machine" + "Pay for the Printer" by Phillip K. Dick, "All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace" Pt. 2
- In both stories, Phillip K. Dick poses a dystopian future where men have become too reliant on machines, or in the case of "Pay for the Printer," <i>Bitlong</i> aliens with machine-like behavior. In this story, humans are born again as a civilization by going back to their origins and building tools by hand once again, losing their dependance on <i>Bitlongs</i> and their prints. In "The Preserving Machine," there seems to a be a concept of blackbox, as Doc Labyrinth does not understand the functioning of his own machine, but feels unable to turn back or alter the results. Further, this story relates to the perhaps flawed notion of nature as a perfectly balanced system presented in BBC's "All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace". Both of Dick's stories seem to be cautionary tales of machines functioning in the detriment of humans, wether because we expect too much of them or because we fail to understand their functionality. The BBC documentary goes a step further in presenting real life examples of communities that model life after the functioning of machines.
- "Each time a creature came out he was astonished; he did not seem to have control over the results at all. It was out of his hands, subject to some strong, invisible law that had subtly taken over, and this worried him greatly."
- Though this was written in the 1950s, Dick shows a concern for blackbox mechanisms, i.e. machines that function beyond the understanding and control of their creators/users. This seems to tie into our last class discussion.
- Machines overtaking humans is an often explored path in dystopian sci-fi stories, but is overdependance in machines an equally concerning future? If so, is the trend of IOT pushing humanity in that direction?
